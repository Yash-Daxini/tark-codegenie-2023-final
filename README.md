- [ ] Milestone-1 incomplete
- [ ] Milestone-2 incomplete

Code is not working in case where need to take some seats from one coach and remaining from another coach.

So , need to change condition accordingly or modify hashmap according to input . Hashmap contains only single coach which means key is s and sum of s1 , s2 , s3 and upto sn is as value. This can pass the milestone 1.
